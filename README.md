# EV-Population-Analysis
 
**Overview**

This project analyzes the growth and distribution of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Washington State from 1999 to 2024. The goal is to identify adoption trends, leading manufacturers, and county-wise distribution, providing insights into the increasing shift toward sustainable transportation.

**Dataset**

Source: Washington State Department of Licensing

Contents: The dataset includes information on EV registrations by model year, manufacturer, model, and county.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

Power BI: Used for interactive dashboards and data visualization

Python: Data preprocessing and statistical analysis

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data analysis and visualization

**Key Insights**

Median Year-on-Year (YoY) growth in EVs is 67.57%.

The largest growth occurred in 2011, with a 2904% increase, representing a 29x jump in EV adoption.

Total EVs in Washington: 219,000 registered as of 2024.

King County leads with 110,000 EVs, nearly 50% of the total EV population in the state.

Tesla holds a dominant market share of 51.29%, making it the most popular EV brand in Washington.
