# EV-Population-Analysis
 
**Overview**

This project analyzes the growth and distribution of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Washington State from 1999 to 2024. The goal is to identify adoption trends, leading manufacturers, and county-wise distribution, providing insights into the increasing shift toward sustainable transportation.

**Dataset**

Source: Washington State Department of Licensing

Contents: The dataset includes information on EV registrations by model year, manufacturer, model, and county.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

Power BI: Used for interactive dashboards and data visualization

Python: Data preprocessing and statistical analysis

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data analysis and visualization

**Key Focus Areas**

Trend Analysis: Year-on-Year (YoY) growth of EV adoption over time.

Market Share: Identifying top EV manufacturers and their dominance.

Geographical Distribution: Understanding county-wise EV registrations.


**Key Insights**

The largest growth occurred in 2011, with a 2904% increase, representing a 29x jump in EV adoption.

Total EVs in Washington: 219,000 registered as of 2024.

King County leads with 110,000 EVs, nearly 50% of the total EV population in the state.

Tesla holds a dominant market share of 51.29%, making it the most popular EV brand in Washington.

The chart illustrates a significant upward trend in EV registrations over time. Initially, the numbers were modest during the late 1990s and early 2000s, but they began to rise steadily in the 2010s and surged dramatically after 2020. The polynomial trend line emphasizes this accelerating growth, suggesting that if current trends continue, EV adoption will likely keep increasing rapidly.

**Market Share of Top EV Brands**

Tesla dominates the EV market with over 93,000 vehicles, far outpacing competitors. Mid-tier players like Chevrolet, Nissan, Ford, and Kia each exceed 10,000 vehicles, suggesting a competitive field just behind Tesla. Meanwhile, traditional brands such as Toyota, BMW, Hyundai, Jeep, and Volkswagen have also carved out a place in the top 10, highlighting their growing but still modest inroads into the EV sector
